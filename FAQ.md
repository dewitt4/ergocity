# ErgoCity - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is ErgoCity?

ErgoCity is an interactive web application that teaches you about ergodicity through a gamified experience. It shows how individual experiences can differ from group averages in systems with multiplicative outcomes (like investing or business growth).

### Do I need cryptocurrency to use ErgoCity?

**No!** ErgoCity has a **Simulation Mode** that requires nothing but a web browser. You can learn and play without any cryptocurrency, wallet, or technical setup.

If you want to use the **Blockchain Mode** (advanced), you'll need:
- A cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect-compatible)
- A small amount of MATIC (Polygon network cryptocurrency) for transaction fees

### Is ErgoCity gambling?

**No.** ErgoCity is an educational tool designed to teach mathematical concepts. While it involves probability and risk, its purpose is learning, not profit. The simulation mode uses no real money, and the blockchain mode is designed for demonstration and education.

### How much does it cost to use ErgoCity?

**Simulation Mode**: Completely free, no costs at all.

**Blockchain Mode**: You only pay small blockchain transaction fees (called "gas fees"), typically $0.01-0.05 per transaction in MATIC. There are no platform fees or subscription costs.

### Is ErgoCity safe?

**Yes**, ErgoCity is safe because:
- It doesn't store or control your money
- Your wallet remains in your control
- The simulation mode has zero financial risk
- The smart contract code follows security best practices
- No personal information is collected

## Understanding the Game

### What is ergodicity and why should I care?

**Ergodicity** is a property where the average of a group at one time equals the average of one person over time.

**Why it matters**: Most real-world financial situations (investing, business, career) are **NON-ergodic**. This means:
- What works for most people once might not work for you repeatedly
- Average returns don't guarantee your personal returns
- Long-term strategy requires different thinking than short-term averages

**Example**: If 100 people each flip a coin once, about 50 win. But if you flip 100 times with multiplicative outcomes, you likely end up losing even with 50% odds!

### Why do I lose money even with "good odds"?

This is the **ergodic paradox**! Here's why:

With the LOW risk protocol (55% win rate):
- **Ensemble view** (100 people, 1 round each): On average, more winners than losers
- **Time view** (1 person, 100 rounds): Likely to lose over time

**The reason**: Losses hurt more than wins help in multiplicative systems.
- Winning 55 times: +29.1% each time
- Losing 45 times: -30.0% each time
- The -30% losses multiply down more than the +29.1% gains multiply up!

**Real-world example**: This is why even with "good odds" in investing, you can lose money without proper position sizing.

### What's the difference between Ensemble Average and my score?

- **Your Score (Time Average)**: Your individual journey over multiple rounds
- **Ensemble Average**: The average of all players' scores at this moment

In non-ergodic systems (like ErgoCity), these often differ significantly. This difference is what makes understanding ergodicity important for real-world decision-making!

### Which risk protocol should I choose?

**For Learning**: Start with **LOW** risk
- See the ergodicity effect clearly
- Safe for experimentation
- Good for understanding the basics

**For Demonstration**: Try **MEDIUM** risk  
- More dramatic results
- Clear multiplicative effects
- Good balance for education

**For Maximum Effect**: Try **EXTREME** or **MAXIMUM**
- Highest variance
- Most dramatic demonstrations
- Shows extreme outcomes quickly

**Strategy Tip**: In multiplicative systems, "better odds" don't always mean better outcomes! This is a key lesson.

## Simulation Mode

### What's the difference between Simulation Mode and Blockchain Mode?

| Feature | Simulation Mode | Blockchain Mode |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Setup Required | None | Wallet + MATIC |
| Cost | Free | Small fees (~$0.01-0.05/tx) |
| Speed | Instant (2-3 sec) | 5-30 seconds |
| Persistence | Local only | Blockchain record |
| Contributes to Stats | No | Yes |
| Reset | Unlimited | Available when score = 0 |

### Can I save my simulation results?

Currently, simulation results are stored only in your browser's memory. If you refresh the page, your simulation history is lost. We recommend:
- Taking screenshots if you want records
- Using the "SHOW LOG" feature to see recent transactions
- Writing down interesting outcomes for learning purposes

### Why does the simulation run for 2-3 seconds?

The delay is intentional to create suspense and simulate the feeling of a real transaction. It makes the experience more engaging and helps you reflect on the risk you're taking.

## Blockchain Mode

### What is a blockchain wallet?

A **blockchain wallet** is software that stores your cryptocurrency and lets you interact with blockchain applications. Think of it like a digital wallet that:
- Holds your cryptocurrency
- Signs transactions to prove they're from you
- Connects to dApps like ErgoCity
- Keeps your funds secure

Popular wallets: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet

### What is MATIC and why do I need it?

**MATIC** is the cryptocurrency that powers the Polygon network. You need small amounts of MATIC to pay "gas fees" - the cost of processing your transactions on the blockchain.

**How much do I need?**: $1-2 worth of MATIC is enough for dozens of ErgoCity transactions.

**Where to get it**:
- Purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
- Transfer from another wallet
- Use a faucet (free small amounts) for testing

### What is the Polygon Network?

**Polygon** is a "Layer 2" blockchain network that processes transactions faster and cheaper than Ethereum (the main blockchain). It costs much less to use:
- Ethereum transaction: $1-50+
- Polygon transaction: $0.01-0.10

ErgoCity uses Polygon so you can learn without expensive fees!

### How do I connect my wallet?

**MetaMask (Desktop)**:
1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Create or import a wallet
3. Switch to Polygon network in MetaMask
4. Visit ErgoCity
5. Click "Connect Wallet"
6. Approve the connection

**WalletConnect (Mobile)**:
1. Install a WalletConnect-compatible wallet (Trust Wallet, Rainbow, etc.)
2. Create or import a wallet
3. Add Polygon network
4. Visit ErgoCity on your phone
5. Click "Connect Wallet"
6. Scan QR code with your wallet app

### Why do I need to "Register Identity"?

Registration creates your player account on the blockchain. It:
- Records that you're a participant
- Initializes your score at 1,000 units
- Adds you to the ensemble statistics
- Allows you to play on the blockchain

This is a one-time transaction that costs a small gas fee.

### What if my score reaches zero?

If you lose all your units (score = 0):
1. Your play button will be disabled
2. A "Reset Score" button will appear
3. Click "Reset Score" and approve the transaction
4. Your score returns to 1,000 units
5. You can continue playing!

**Note**: Resetting costs a small gas fee (≈$0.01-0.05).

### How long do transactions take?

Blockchain transactions typically take:
- **Fast**: 5-15 seconds (most common)
- **Normal**: 15-30 seconds
- **Slow**: 30-60 seconds (during high network activity)

Be patient and don't submit multiple transactions! Check your wallet for transaction status.

### What are gas fees exactly?

**Gas fees** are payments to the blockchain network for processing your transaction. Think of them as:
- Postage for sending a letter
- A tip for the computers processing your request
- Rent for using the blockchain's computing power

These fees:
- Go to network validators, not ErgoCity
- Vary based on network congestion
- Are always paid in MATIC on Polygon
- Typically cost $0.01-0.05 per transaction

## Troubleshooting

### "Please connect your wallet to interact"

**Cause**: No wallet is connected to ErgoCity.

**Solution**: Click the wallet connection button (usually top corner) and follow the prompts to connect MetaMask or WalletConnect.

### "Insufficient MATIC for gas"

**Cause**: Your wallet doesn't have enough MATIC to pay transaction fees.

**Solution**: 
1. Purchase MATIC on an exchange
2. Send it to your wallet address
3. Wait for it to arrive (usually 1-5 minutes)
4. Try your transaction again

### "Incorrect Network"

**Cause**: Your wallet is connected to the wrong blockchain (e.g., Ethereum instead of Polygon).

**Solution**: 
1. Open your wallet
2. Find the network selector (usually shows "Ethereum Mainnet")
3. Switch to "Polygon Mainnet" or "Polygon"
4. Refresh ErgoCity if needed

### "Transaction Failed"

**Possible Causes**:
1. Insufficient gas
2. Transaction rejected in wallet
3. Network congestion
4. Contract error (rare)

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have enough MATIC
- Try again with slightly higher gas
- Wait a few minutes if network is busy
- Check transaction on Polygonscan for details

### MetaMask shows "Nonce too high"

**Cause**: A transaction is stuck or multiple pending transactions.

**Solution**:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Activity" tab
3. Find pending transactions
4. Click "Cancel" or "Speed Up"
5. Wait for resolution
6. Try your ErgoCity transaction again

### My transaction is pending forever

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes (sometimes network is slow)
2. Check Polygonscan.com with your transaction hash
3. If truly stuck, speed up the transaction in your wallet
4. As a last resort, reset your wallet's account (Advanced settings in MetaMask)

### The numbers look wrong

**Check**:
1. Are you looking at the right balance? (MATIC vs. Units)
2. Simulation vs. Blockchain mode scores are separate
3. Remember: multiplicative changes compound quickly!

### I accidentally disconnected my wallet

**Solution**: Just click "Connect Wallet" again and approve. Your blockchain score is permanently saved, so you won't lose any data.

## Learning and Strategy

### How many rounds should I play?

**For Learning**:
- Play at least 20-30 rounds in simulation
- Try different risk protocols
- Observe patterns and outcomes
- Compare to ensemble average

**For Understanding Ergodicity**:
- 50-100 rounds shows clearer patterns
- Track your journey vs. starting point
- Notice the multiplicative effects compound

### Is there a "winning strategy"?

**The Point**: The purpose of ErgoCity is to learn, not to "win." In fact, the mathematical design shows that even "favorable" odds can lead to long-term losses in multiplicative systems.

**Real-World Lesson**: This is why in investing:
- Position sizing matters (Kelly Criterion)
- Diversification is crucial
- Risk management beats "good picks"
- Long-term compounding requires surviving bad periods

### What should I learn from ErgoCity?

**Key Lessons**:

1. **Multiplicative vs. Additive**: Multiplication changes the game completely
2. **Ensemble ≠ Time Average**: Group average ≠ your personal journey
3. **Volatility Costs**: Even with good odds, variance can destroy you
4. **Survival Matters**: One big loss can wipe out many wins
5. **Risk Management**: Conservative approaches often win long-term

**Apply to Real Life**:
- Investing: Don't over-leverage, even with "sure things"
- Business: Preserve capital, manage downside
- Career: Build safety nets, don't risk everything
- Decision-making: Consider multiplicative consequences
