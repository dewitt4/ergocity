- Purchase on Coinbase, Binance, or another exchange
- Send to your wallet address
- Or use a faucet for small test amounts

#### 3. Switch to Polygon Network
In MetaMask:
- Click network dropdown (top of MetaMask)
- Select "Polygon Mainnet"
- (If not listed, add it manually with Chain ID: 137)

#### 4. Connect to ErgoCity
- Find the wallet button (usually in sidebar or top corner)
- Click "Connect MetaMask" or "Connect Wallet"
- Approve the connection request

#### 5. Register Your Identity
- Look for the purple "Engage ErgoDrive" box

## 📊 Understanding Your Screen

### Top Section: Score Displays

**Current (Simulated) Balance**
- Your score in simulation mode
- Starts at 1,000 units
- Ephemeral (resets when you refresh)

**Ensemble Average (Grid)**
- Average of ALL blockchain players
- Updated in real-time
- Shows the "group average"

### Middle Section: Blockchain Engagement

**Engage ErgoDrive**

- Register for blockchain mode
- Play on the blockchain
- See your permanent score

### Risk Protocol Cards

Each card shows:
- **Risk Level**: LOW to MAXIMUM
- **Success Rate**: % chance to win (55% to 80%)
- **Win Bonus**: How much you gain if you win
- **Loss Penalty**: How much you lose if you lose

## 🎯 Quick Tips

### For Simulation Mode:
✅ Start with LOW risk to understand the game
✅ Play 20-30 rounds to see patterns
✅ Try different risk levels
✅ Click "RESET SIMULATED PROTOCOL" to start over
✅ Use "SHOW LOG" to see your history

### For Blockchain Mode:
✅ Start with small amounts
✅ Keep extra MATIC for transaction fees
✅ Be patient - transactions take 5-30 seconds
✅ Check Polygonscan if a transaction seems stuck
✅ You can reset if your score hits zero

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Playing without understanding**
   - Read the Ergodic Paradox explanation on the page
   - Try simulation mode first!

2. **Choosing high risk too early**
   - Start with LOW or MILD risk
   - Understand the mechanics before going extreme

3. **Not reading transaction confirmations**
   - Always check your wallet before approving
   - Verify the transaction fee is reasonable

4. **Expecting to "win" long-term**
   - This is educational, not a money-maker
   - Even with good odds, you can lose over time
   - That's the whole point of the ergodicity lesson!

5. **Wrong network** (Blockchain mode)
   - Make sure you're on Polygon, not Ethereum
   - Check your wallet's network selector

---

## 🆘 Stuck? Quick Troubleshooting

**"Can't connect wallet"**
→ Refresh page, unlock wallet, try again

**"Insufficient MATIC"**
→ You need more MATIC for gas fees

**"Wrong network"**
→ Switch to Polygon in your wallet

**"Transaction pending forever"**
→ Wait 2-3 minutes, check Polygonscan with transaction hash

**"Score is zero"**
→ Click "Reset Score" to get 1,000 units back
