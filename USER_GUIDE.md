## What is ErgoCity?

ErgoCity is an educational platform that teaches you about **ergodicity** - a mathematical concept that shows how individual experiences can differ from group averages in certain situations.

### The Core Concept

Imagine you and 100 friends each start with $1,000 and play a game where:
- You have a 60% chance to win and gain money
- You have a 40% chance to lose and lose money

**Here's the fascinating part:**
- If you look at all 100 people after one round (the "ensemble average"), on average they might have more money
- But if you look at one person playing 100 rounds (the "time average"), they might end up with less money

This is the **ergodic paradox** - and ErgoCity lets you explore this concept hands-on!

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

**For Local Simulation (No Setup Required):**
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection
- No cryptocurrency or wallet needed!

**For Blockchain Mode (Advanced):**
- A cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect-compatible wallet)
- A small amount of MATIC (Polygon network cryptocurrency) for transaction fees
- Basic understanding of cryptocurrency wallets

### First Visit

1. **Open ErgoCity** in your web browser
2. You'll see a futuristic interface with:
   - **ERGOCITY** title at the top with glitching effects
   - Two score displays showing "Current Balance" and "Ensemble Average"
   - Risk protocol options (LOW, MILD, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME, MAXIMUM)
   - Two play buttons: one for simulation and one for blockchain

---

## How to Use ErgoCity

### The Two Modes

ErgoCity offers two ways to experience the game:

#### 1. **Local Simulation Mode** (Recommended for Beginners)
- Play immediately without any setup
- No real money involved
- Perfect for learning and experimentation
- Located in the upper section of the page

#### 2. **Blockchain Mode** (Advanced)
- Connects to the Polygon blockchain
- Requires a cryptocurrency wallet
- Your scores are stored on the blockchain
- Contributes to the "Ensemble Average" that all players can see
- Located in the middle section labeled "ENTER GRID ENGAGEMENT (BLOCKCHAIN)"

---

## Understanding the Game

### Your Score

- You start with **1,000 units**
- Each round, you select a "Risk Protocol" and play
- Your score multiplies based on whether you win or lose

### Risk Protocols

ErgoCity offers 6 different risk levels, each with different odds:

| Risk Level | Success Rate | Win Bonus | Loss Penalty | Description |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **LOW** ⚡ | 55% | +29.1% | -30.0% | Safest option, moderate gains |
| **MILD** 🔥 | 60% | +39.07% | -42.0% | Balanced risk and reward |
| **MEDIUM** ⚔️ | 65% | +47.31% | -54.0% | Higher rewards, higher risk |
| **HIGH** 💀 | 70% | +54.31% | -66.0% | Significant risk for bigger gains |
| **EXTREME** ☠️ | 75% | +61.29% | -78.0% | Very risky, very rewarding |
| **MAXIMUM** 🌀 | 80% | +73.43% | -90.0% | Highest risk and reward |

### How Scoring Works

The game uses **multiplicative** changes to your score:

**Example with LOW risk (starting with 1,000 units):**

**If you WIN (55% chance):**
- Your score increases by 29.1%
- New score = 1,000 × 1.291 = **1,291 units**
- You gained 291 units!

**If you LOSE (45% chance):**
- Your score decreases by 30.0%
- New score = 1,000 × 0.70 = **700 units**
- You lost 300 units

> **Important:** Each round multiplies your current score, so your gains and losses compound over time!

## Safety and Best Practices

### For Simulation Mode
✅ **Completely Safe** - No real money or cryptocurrency involved
✅ Experiment freely and reset as often as you like
✅ Perfect for learning and strategy testing

### For Blockchain Mode

**Before You Start:**
- ⚠️ Only use money you can afford to lose
- 💡 Start with small amounts of MATIC
- 🔒 Never share your wallet's private key or seed phrase
- 🔐 Use a reputable wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)

**During Gameplay:**
- 📊 Start with LOW risk to learn the mechanics
- ⏰ Be patient - blockchain transactions take time
- 💰 Keep extra MATIC for transaction fees
- 🎯 Remember: This is educational, not a money-making scheme

**Wallet Security:**
- 🔑 Keep your seed phrase written down and stored safely offline
- 🚫 Never enter your seed phrase on websites
- ✅ Always verify you're on the correct website
- 🛡️ Use hardware wallets for large amounts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Please connect your wallet to interact"
**Solution:** Click the wallet connection button and approve the connection request in your wallet.

#### "Insufficient MATIC for gas"
**Solution:** You need more MATIC in your wallet for transaction fees. Purchase a small amount through your wallet or a cryptocurrency exchange.

#### "Incorrect Network. Please switch to target network"
**Solution:** Your wallet is connected to the wrong blockchain network. Switch to Polygon (MATIC) network in your wallet settings.

#### "Contract not found at configured address"
**Solution:** The blockchain contract may not be deployed on the network you're connected to. Verify you're on Polygon network.

#### "Score is zero. Reset to play"
**Solution:** Your blockchain score has reached zero. Click "Reset Score" to return to 1,000 units.

#### "Already registered with a score"
**Solution:** You're already registered! You can start playing immediately using "Engage ErgoDrive!"

#### Transaction is Pending for a Long Time
**Solution:** Blockchain transactions can take 10-60 seconds during high network activity. Be patient and don't submit multiple transactions.

#### MetaMask Not Showing Up
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure MetaMask is installed
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check if MetaMask is unlocked
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

---

## Tips for Understanding Ergodicity

1. **Play Many Rounds in Simulation**
   - Play 20-50 rounds and track your score
   - Notice how it tends to decrease over time, even with "good odds"

2. **Compare to Ensemble Average**
   - Look at the Ensemble Average (all blockchain players)
   - Compare it to your individual journey
   - They're often different - that's the ergodic paradox!

3. **Experiment with Different Protocols**
   - Try LOW risk for 20 rounds
   - Reset and try HIGH risk for 20 rounds
   - See which strategy works better long-term

4. **Understand Compounding**
   - Winning 3 times: 1000 × 1.291 × 1.291 × 1.291 = 2,152
   - Losing 3 times: 1000 × 0.70 × 0.70 × 0.70 = 343
   - Even good odds can lead to losses with multiplication!
